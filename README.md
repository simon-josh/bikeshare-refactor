### Project Title
Refactoring the Bikeshare project

### Description
#Describe what your project is about and what it does
(1). Introduction:
In this project, I am to refactor my previous BikeShare project using Git.
I forked the current Udacity repository to get my own copy of a template for this project, so that I have a remote repository in my Githut account, and then clone it to my computer. I add my bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore file to exclude the data file from version control tracking.
I will create and work on the two branched. Finally, I will merge both branches to the master branch, and push it back up to the remote repository in my Githut account.

(2). Delete unnecessary comment form the line 125 to 134.
